This project includes the following files:

- RandomizationGSD.R generates randomization sequences for a specified randomization procedure and calculates type I error and power conditioned on each generated sequence.
- Plot_and_Save.R generates and analyzes data for type I error and power across various group sequential designs and randomization procedures, saves the results to Excel files and includes functions for figure creation and visualization.
- standards.R, provided by Chris Jennison, calculates properties of group sequential boundaries.
