The following files are included in this project:

- RandomizationGSD.R: Generates randomization sequences for a randomization procedure and calculates type I error and power conditioned on each generated randomization sequences.
- Plot_and_Save.R: Generates data for type I error and power for different group sequential designs and randomization procedures and saves them to excel files. Also includes functions for figure creation.
- standards.R: Calculates properties of group sequential boundaries. File provided by Chris Jennison.
